NEAT-Based Stock Trend Prediction
This project, developed by Amal Baby Mathews, utilizes the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library to evolve neural network topologies for predicting stock trends.

Project Objective:

The primary goal is to train generations of neural networks using the NEAT algorithm, aiming to achieve accurate stock trend prediction on the TSLA dataset. The project explores the potential of evolving neural network topologies through NEAT principles for financial forecasting applications.

Methodology:

The NEAT library ([invalid URL removed]) is employed to create and evolve neural network architectures.
The training data consists of the TSLA stock dataset, likely including historical pricing data and relevant features.
Each generation undergoes training and fitness evaluation based on their prediction accuracy on the dataset.
Individuals with higher fitness (more accurate predictions) are selected for reproduction and mutation, leading to progressively better generations.
Key Features:

Leverages the NEAT algorithm for evolving neural network topologies.
Trains networks on the TSLA stock dataset for trend prediction.
Employs iterative training and evaluation for continuous improvement.
Aims to achieve accurate stock trend prediction through NEAT principles.
Dependencies:

NEAT library 
Other relevant libraries as needed (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)
Data:

This section should describe the specific TSLA stock data your project uses, including:
Data source (e.g., financial APIs, historical databases)
Timeframe covered
Features included (e.g., opening, closing price, volume)
Preprocessing steps applied
Limitations:

While this project aims for accurate predictions, it's important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of stock market forecasting:
Market volatility and external factors are difficult to predict with certainty.
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Further Development:

Explore additional data sources and financial instruments.
Experiment with different evolutionary parameters and fitness functions.
Visualize network topologies and analyze evolved traits.
Compare performance with other prediction methods.
